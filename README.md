# Project: JUnit testing for an insurance program.  
This program involves running JUnit tests on an insurance program that calculates car insurance premium based on age and accident history.

Module: Agile Software Development

### Description:   
• The original Insurance Program file (InsuranceProgram-OriginalVersion.java) was refactored so that it could be tested effectively using JUnit5.  
• A JUnit automated test suite was developed that is capable of testing the refactored program (InsuranceProgram.java).  
• The following annotations were used: @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @Test, @ParameterizedTest, @Timeout, @AfterAll and @AfterEach.  
• The following exceptions were tested for: NullPointerException and IllegalArgumentException.  
            
### How to run: 
Upload all files from the src folder into your IDE. To run JUnit test, run the InsuranceProgramTestSuite.java file.      
            
### Technology used:  
• Java 19   
• JUnit 5
